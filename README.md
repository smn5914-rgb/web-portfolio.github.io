**Name:** Samiya Naseer  
**Student ID:** 965953509  
**Course:** IST 256  
**Assignment Title:** Assignment 2 – CSS Styling for Portfolio (HTML + CSS)  

## Project Description
This project enhances my HTML5 portfolio from Assignment 1 by applying comprehensive CSS styling to create a more visually appealing, responsive, and professional-looking web page. The portfolio keeps the same text/content as the original HTML and focuses on demonstrating CSS layout, design organization, and responsive styling.

## What’s Included
- Semantic HTML structure (header, nav, main, section, aside, footer)
- External CSS stylesheet as the primary styling source  
- Internal CSS (small page-specific override inside the `<head>`)
- Inline CSS (used sparingly for one-off styling, such as progress bar widths)
- Responsive layout using **Flexbox** (navigation) and **CSS Grid** (page layout)
- Styled table and styled contact form with focus/validation states
- CSS custom properties (design tokens) for consistent colors, spacing, and typography
- Basic transitions/animations + reduced motion support

## Folder / File Structure
- `Naseer_Samiya_portfolio.html` (main HTML page)
- `styles/main.css` (external stylesheet)
- Images and documents used by the portfolio (examples):
  - `IMG_5040 copy.jpg`
  - `topology copy.png`
  - `Resume copy.pdf`

## Notes About Implementation
- The external stylesheet is linked in the HTML using:
  - `href="styles/main.css"`
- Internal CSS is included only for a small page-specific tweak (to meet the assignment requirement).
- Inline CSS is used minimally and only where it makes sense (one-off/dynamic values), with comments explaining why.

## How to View
